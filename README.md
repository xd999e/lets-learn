# What is this about?

Let's learn something. Just some notes created while learning some new (mostly) technical stuff, because I'm very good at forgetting things. Especially when I can't use them every day. This should give an overview of the most important things about a topic.

## What is this not about?

This repository is not here to explain or learn everything step-by-step. It's more about having important information at a glance.

## Can you use this?

I hope so? However, the information is described in such a way that I can cope with it. If YOU can cope with the information in the same way, then feel free to use it or even contribute.

## Why some directories are empty?

Interpret it as "scheduled for later". Looks like I've found an interesting topic or tool that I'd like to dig deeper into (later).

## What is the best way to use this repository?

I'm working with Obsidian here. So all link references are made with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The best way to use this repository is:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/xd999e/lets-learn.git`
2. Open the directory with Obsidian to get all extensions. (included in .obsidian folder)
